What It Does
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a little tool that you can use to launch the bulit in PHP testing HTTP
server with a few clicks. It lets you select which PHP binary you want to use in
case you are dealing with multiple versions, but prefills the entry with what
appears to be whatever is the default binary on your system.


Current State
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have only tested it on Windows 7 so far, but I have taken care of the Unixen I
just need to get around to testing it instead of playing Saints Row 3 when I get
home.
